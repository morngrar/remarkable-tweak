# remarkable-tweak
Tweak tool for the reMarkable paper tablet. Lets you organize your templates with no fuss.

Can now be installed with "pip":

### Instructions
- Install python 3.x from [python.org](https://www.python.org/downloads/)
(if you're on linux, this is probably already on your system)

- In a terminal or console window enter `pip install remarkable-tweak`. This
  should take care of the installation for you, however on some systems you
  may have to use `pip3` as the command instead.

- Run the tool with the command `remarkable-tweak` either from a terminal
  window, Windows' 'Run' dialog, or similar. Your reMarkable has to be
  connected via the stock USB cable.

- You also need your tablet's password, which you find under About->'GPLv3
  Compliance' (lower right corner of About-screen)

    - To get to this menu, you simply tap the 'rM' logo in the top left corner
      of your overview-screen.



*NOTE*: This is currently in a BETA stage of development. Testing needs to be done on Windows and iOS. Please contact if interested in contributing.
