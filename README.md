# remarkable-tweak
Tweak tool for the reMarkable paper tablet. Lets you organize your templates with no fuss.

Can now be run using `python3 main.py', and should work on linux, as long as Pillow is installed (pip install pillow). An installable package supporting linux, windows and ios shall soon be made, and put onto PyPI.

*NOTE* This is currently a very early stage, and not ready for release. Please contact if interested in contributing, though.
