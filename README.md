# remarkable-tweak
Tweak tool for the reMarkable paper tablet. Lets you organize your templates with no fuss.

Can now be run using `python3 main.py`, and should work on linux, as long as Pillow is installed (`pip install Pillow`). An installable package supporting linux, windows and ios shall soon be made, and put onto PyPI.

*NOTE*: This is currently a very early stage, and not ready for release. Please contact if interested in contributing, though.
