# remarkable-tweak
Tweak tool for the reMarkable paper tablet. Lets you organize your templates with no fuss.

⚠️ **NOTE: Repo is archived.** ⚠️ 

**The changes to the official ReMarkable software makes this project redundant and obsolete for me personally. If you find value in it still, you are free to fork it as the license permits**

Can now be installed with "pip":

### Instructions
- Install python 3.x from [python.org](https://www.python.org/downloads/)
(if you're on linux, this is probably already on your system)

- In a terminal or console window enter `pip install remarkable-tweak`. This
  should take care of the installation for you, however on some systems you
  may have to use `pip3` as the command instead.

- Run the tool with the command `remarkable-tweak` either from a terminal
  window, Windows' 'Run' dialog, or similar. Your reMarkable has to be
  connected via the stock USB cable.

- You also need your tablet's password, which you find under About->'GPLv3
  Compliance' (lower right corner of About-screen)

    - To get to this menu, you simply tap the 'rM' logo in the top left corner
      of your overview-screen.



*NOTE*: This is currently in a BETA stage of development. Testing needs to be done on Windows and iOS. Please contact if interested in contributing.
